# Python-Autocad-Distance-between-points-on-the-line
Draw distance between points on the polyline in Autocad

This is a python code writen using pyautocad library.

To use this Autocad command you need to have just a polyline on a drawing and then just start the frontovi.exe file. You can also create an Autocad icon for this file using CUI. This command is set to draw distances on 2 decimal places, but it can be changed in the code.
